# Community_Bot

Community bot is a (currently planned to be) discord bot that aims to help make organizing a channel much easier.

## Dependencies:
iCalendar (https://github.com/collective/icalendar)
* This is not necessary, but if you want to be able to export the generated schedule, then it is needed

## Under works:
* Survey Module
* Scheduler Module

## Things that need to be done:
* Mongo DB integration
* Output certain results to Google Sheets (may end up displaying information elsewhere)
* Make the scheduler module output urls that will send .ics files for members to keep track of events
* Create setup.py file for installing dependencies
