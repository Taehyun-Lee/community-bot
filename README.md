# Community_Bot

Community bot is a (currently planned to be) discord bot that aims to help make organizing a channel much easier.

## Under works:
* Survey Module
* Scheduler Module

## Things that need to be done:
* Mongo DB integration
* Output certain results to Google Sheets (may end up displaying information elsewhere)
* Make the scheduler module output urls that will send .ics files for members to keep track of events
